    <h1>About me</h1>
<div class="about-page">

    <p> Hello my name is Ernesto Cruz III, Trei for short. Through my father I was introduced to computers. Growing up he was IT specialist, even routed the first ethernet cables at the school I was attending (early 2000's). From there my love of tech has grown over various avenues. 
      First Movie Maker, then Adobe products such as Photoshop, After Effects, etc..., then into my high school years. I was accepted into DECSA, a program that allowed me to obtain my Associates of Computer Science all while going to high school.

      After completing my associates degree, I decided to join the US Air Force, as a 2T Airman (logistics job). During those years the tech field always called my name, I took on rolls such as Equipment Manager, headed up a project integrating tablet computers into the work space,
      and was known as the inhouse "tech guy" which I loved doing. 
     
     When it came time to reenlist I decided to continue my adventure into academia and separated honorably. I decided to attend the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, pursuing a degree from the College of Innovation, in CS. Due to COVID-19 I transferred to the University of
      Texas San Antonio, where I am pursuing a CS degree. 
     
     I am extremely grateful for every step it took to get to where I am today and am very thankful for those who have inspired me to keep pursuing my passion. 
     
     Stay positive! 
     -Trei</p>
